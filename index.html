        title: 'On talent sabotage in capitalism',
        date: '2025-09-01',
        excerpt: 'How capitalist structures unintentionally suppress creativity and talent.',
        body: `
 <p>Capitalism sabotages talent… What do I mean by that? well before that we must understand 
  what is talent? Google defines it as “natural aptitude or skill” and how is that built? Is it naturally 
  intrinsic to one’s self since birth? absolutely not.</p>

  <p>Modern neuroscience and psychology tells us that character that includes talent is developed by 
  the environment. What does that mean? It means that a set of talents are always deterministic 
  so person X born in London/NYC is always bound to have more “talent” than someone born in 
  India or Nigeria. That's a biological fact. The exposure of early education and environment plays 
  a huge role. That's how the “brain” , while I will not be getting into details here today but our 
  actions department ie the prefrontal cortex is heavily dependent on the environment.</p>

  <p>Now there is an inherently flawed argument that people use. That is, of outliers they will point 
  out isolated cases and say “well it's all about hardwork” look at where Lincoln came from. This is 
  blatantly wrong, So what happens in this case is a spark which by virtue is deterministic. In the 
  event of being successful, let's call it “A” and let's call the spark “B” (Spark here could be 
  anything finding a book to a server), Now for A to happen B must logical precede, so we can 
  draw the conclusion that probability of A happening is contingent upon B.</p>

  <p>You may wonder why I dig this case so much? Well there is a reason these isolated cases we 
  talked about are random. B could have happened or not happened. It was a sheer coincidence 
  that Ramanujan found the book that will specifically aid him. One can trace this event in any 
  case study of successful people who didn't come from successful backgrounds. If we assume 
  this event is C that preceded B which means A is not contingent upon B and C, let's assume 
  there are N set of possibilities for C and B is one of them, Now N here should be practically a 
  very large set as anything could have sparked that day which could lead the cause of B, That 
  means now A is dependent on this huge set of N.</p>

  <p>Mathematically speaking what's the probability of a subset of successful Spark here? that could 
  lead to a satisfactory A? impossible to draw a conclusion. Hence we can conclude that these 
  “sparks” ie B are very arbitrary and random almost directly proportional to the fact that the worse 
  your environment is the lower it is.</p>

  <p>So these “success” stories you see from hard work and hustle aren't really because of hard 
  work but predetermined circumstances. Now in a capitalist world order this is almost 
  fundamentally gonna stay the same, One cannot change it as its a feature. The goal is 
  capitalism is wealth accumulation which by virtue creates the product of hierarchy which would 
  lead to the dilemma we talked about.</p>

  <p>Now what's the alternative? Let's look at a socialist society where such inequality is minimal. 
  The "environment" now would be more even for everyone by which it would universally have 
  greater talent as discussed. In socialist society we would not have to rely on these random 
  sparks. The talent pool grows disproportionately to capitalist counterparts. Mathematically it is 
  impossible that capitalism can have a larger talent pool than a socialist society.</p>

  <p>The preset talent pool of people with good condition that nurtures talent will grow proportionally, 
  so if the talent pool excluding the random isolated events was 200M annually in capitalism 
  (assumptive figure for educated guess) then it means the talent pool without randomness in 
  socialist society would be actually over 50% of the population at the worst possible case it's still 
  over 3 billion dollars, While the assumption in capitalism is 200M is actually a highball for my 
  part another issue to be discussed is waste of talent.</p>

  <p>In a capitalist society you cannot push all 200M people there to meaningful position that puts 
  their talent to work it's impossible capitalism was not made for this, competition will KILL talent 
  not increase it (another stupid assumption that competition = innovation and progress) I will not 
  touch this assumption for today but that's for another day. Regardless in socialism that isn't the 
  issue, innovation and talent isn't “killed” no people do not become lazy, the talent and ambition 
  is just redirected for the better cause of society and not wealth accumulation.</p>

  <p>To assume people get lazier in socialism is an appeal to ignorance fallacy. We do not take away 
  the dopamine hit humans get. It's just directed instead of 10M in the bank to make lives better.</p>

  <p>In essence there are multitude of ways which kills talent in capitalism and that's a sad reality.</p>
