    <h2>Stalin: Material Necessity</h2>
    <p><em>By Irfan Khan</em></p>

    <div class="abstract">
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> This essay argues that Joseph Stalin was not an aberration or a deviation from socialism, but a historical necessity produced by the material conditions of the Soviet Union. It analyzes Stalin’s rule not through moral judgment but through dialectical and historical materialism. The USSR emerged from a backward agrarian economy, encircled by hostile capitalist powers, and threatened by internal counterrevolution. Under such conditions, rapid industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and the centralization of political authority were essential to state survival. Stalin’s system functioned as a historical buffer, enabling the USSR to overcome underdevelopment and defeat Nazi Germany in the largest military conflict in history. The essay further argues that Nikita Khrushchev’s de-Stalinization was a premature political retreat that dismantled stabilizing structures before socialism had matured institutionally. This decision not only fractured the USSR internally but also provided the West with ideological ammunition during the Cold War, contributing to the long-term erosion of Soviet legitimacy and eventual collapse in 1991. History produces necessity before morality, and Stalin must be understood within that necessity.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>History often produces figures who are not morally desirable but structurally necessary. Joseph Stalin was one of them. This essay does not seek to defend Stalin on moral grounds, nor does it justify the repressive aspects of his rule. Instead, it argues from a materialist and dialectical perspective that Stalin was a historical necessity for the survival and consolidation of the Soviet state. The USSR emerged from a backward, agrarian Tsarist empire into a hostile capitalist world system. Under such conditions, industrial acceleration and political centralization were not optional; they were existential. Stalin’s leadership, though brutal, provided the structural buffer required to transform the USSR into a modern industrial power capable of surviving foreign invasion, class struggle, and geopolitical encirclement. The failure to recognize this explains why Nikita Khrushchev’s de-Stalinization was not a triumph of socialism but a premature political retreat that destabilized the Soviet system.



To resume, for such a topic we must understand historical grounding. Marx predicted a revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist order in a developed industrial capitalist society like Britain or Germany not poor tsarist Russia. That matters a lot not only in the context of the USSR but also Mao & China, but for now we must focus on the USSR.



The primary method of the essay and analysis of such remains dialectical to reason.



Due the country being massively under industrialized while entering the Marxist state, it was at a very premature stage. The entire structure of state was at existentialist risk. The USSR faced invasion threats, economic sabotage, and internal counter-revolution. Harsh central control was necessary for survival.

      <h3>Section 1: The Historical Dialectic</h3>
      <p>Stalin’s actions cannot be understood outside of the broader Marxist-Leninist framework of necessity and contradiction...</p>
Through a series of aggressive economic measures most notably the Five-Year Plans and collectivization, Stalin engineered rapid industrial growth that laid the groundwork for the Soviet Union’s emergence as a military and geopolitical superpower by the end of the 1930s.



Prior to Stalin, the Russian Empire’s economy remained overwhelmingly rural, with over 80% of the population employed in agriculture, and industrial development limited to small pockets like St. Petersburg and Moscow (Pipes 1995). The Tsarist regime attempted some modernization after 1890, but development was uneven, heavily dependent on foreign loans and expertise, and lacked a coherent national industrial strategy (Seton-Watson 1967). The devastation of World War I and the subsequent Civil War further crippled production by 1921 industrial output had fallen to just 20% of its 1913 level (Nove 1992). Stalin inherited not only a weak economy but also a vulnerable state dependent on imported machinery and prone to social instability.



Stalin also pursued agricultural collectivization to extract surplus grain to fund industrialization and feed the growing urban workforce. By merging small peasant farms into large collective farms (kolkhozy), the regime aimed to improve agricultural efficiency and secure state control over grain production (Lewin 1975). In practice, collectivization enabled the state to seize grain at low prices and export it to buy industrial machinery from abroad (Davies 1998). Though economically effective in mobilizing resources, the policy triggered violent resistance, mass repression, and famine most notably the Holodomor in Ukraine which caused millions of deaths between 1932 and 1933 (Applebaum 2017).



Now the central question remains under the assumption that the USSR entered socialism as a poor tsarist Russia. Was this scale of Industrialization possible without an unorthodox path? We have to keep in mind USSR was not under any normal circumstances it was surrounded by hostile neighbours.



the USSR attempted to “build socialism in a backward country,” bypassing advanced capitalism altogether (Carr 1952). This unique historical condition forced Soviet leaders to improvise a development model that relied on central planning, state coercion, and rapid capital accumulation through agricultural extraction (Nove 1992). Furthermore, the USSR was not operating in a peaceful international environment, it was surrounded by hostile capitalist powers, isolated diplomatically, excluded from global markets, and threatened militarily by Japan, Poland, Britain, and later Nazi Germany (Roberts 2006). Stalin argued that without accelerated industrialization, the Soviet Union would be crushed, famously declaring, “We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this difference in ten years or they will crush us” (Stalin 1931)



World War 2 & It's consequences



World War II was devastating to the Soviet Union and the world as a whole. As established above, “socialism” in the USSR was prematurely constructed on a backward agrarian base. Yet it was precisely the industrial and military transformation under Stalin that enabled the Soviet Union to survive the single largest invasion in human history Operation Barbarossa in June 1941.



When Nazi Germany invaded, the USSR initially suffered catastrophic losses: by the end of 1941, the Red Army had lost over 3 million soldiers, and the Wehrmacht occupied vast territories including Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Russia (Glantz 1995). German forces reached the outskirts of Moscow, threatening the total collapse of the Soviet state. Yet the industrial base that Stalin had built east of the Ural Mountains became the decisive factor in Soviet resilience. During the early months of the war, over 1,500 factories were relocated from western Soviet territories to Siberia and Central Asia, continuing production far from the front lines (Harrison 1996). By 1943, Soviet wartime industrial output surpassed that of Germany despite the latter occupying territory with 40% of Soviet population and 60% of coal and steel resources (Davies 2006).



Stalin's centralization of power, often criticized as dictatorial, proved decisive in wartime mobilization. The State Defense Committee (GKO) and the Supreme Command (Stavka) ensured rapid decision-making, resource allocation, and coordinated military strategy (Roberts 2006). Although Stalin made grave strategic errors early in the war most notably ignoring repeated warnings of the German invasion (Beevor 1998) he adapted, delegated to capable generals like Zhukov, and adopted a strategy of total war that mobilized the entire society.



The Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 marked a turning point in the war and demonstrated the success of the industrial base built during the Five-Year Plans. Soviet factories produced over 100,000 tanks and self-propelled guns, 130,000 aircraft, and nearly half a million artillery pieces during the war (Harrison 1996). No agrarian, pre-industrial society could have sustained such a war machine. This massive capacity was not accidental but the outcome of state-led forced industrialization.



Incentive to stabilize post WW2



At this point, it becomes clear that Stalin’s role cannot be judged outside the historical conditions of the USSR’s transformation. The Soviet Union was not a developed capitalist society evolving organically into socialism, but a largely agrarian empire attempting to leap directly into industrial modernity. In such a context of economic backwardness, foreign encirclement, and class hostility, Stalin’s centralization of power functioned as a historical buffer—a form of emergency political insulation necessary to hold society together during a violent and unstable transition.



This buffer served three essential functions:



1. Political Cohesion – It prevented ideological fragmentation within the Communist Party at a time when factionalism would have led to civil war or foreign intervention.



2. Economic Command – It enabled long-term industrial planning without paralysis by debate or bureaucratic sabotage.



3. State Survival – It maintained internal order until industrialization created the productive capacity required for socialist stability.


      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Historical necessity undone by Nikita Khrushchev



Whether one condemns or approves of Stalin morally is irrelevant here; his rule was a material response to structural underdevelopment. Socialist construction in an agrarian society required not only economic transformation but also a temporary concentration of power to suppress reactionary forces and prevent premature liberalization.



This is precisely where Nikita Khrushchev’s leadership committed a fundamental historical mistake. By launching de-Stalinization in 1956, he dismantled the very buffer that held the system together before the USSR had developed strong enough institutions to replace it. Khrushchev believed the Soviet state had already reached a stage of socialist maturity and no longer required strict centralization. This was a profound mis calculation. Economic contradictions were still unresolved, national tensions persisted, and ideological development remained shallow among the masses. Yet Khrushchev initiated rapid political relaxation loosening censorship, decentralizing planning, and denouncing Stalin all without completing the transition to a stable socialist base.



Instead of advancing socialism, de-Stalinization exposed the state to ideological shock. By blaming the USSR’s entire historical development on one man, Khrushchev delegitimized the Party’s own past, shattered internal unity, and replaced discipline with confusion. Stalin’s centralized authority, which had functioned as a stabilizing mechanism during the transformation of society, was removed before the Soviet Union had developed new, organic socialist institutions capable of managing pluralism and dissent. In effect, Khrushchev removed the scaffolding before the building had fully solidified.



Thus, Stalin’s role must be understood not as an aberration, but as a dialectical stage: a necessary buffer during the Soviet Union’s transformation from a backward agrarian empire to an industrial superpower. Khrushchev’s failure was not that he criticized Stalin, but that he prematurely dismantled the stabilizing structures of socialism, triggering a long-term process of ideological erosion that ultimately contributed to the collapse of 1991.



De-Stalinization as a Cold War Blunder: Strategic Ammunition for the West



Khrushchev’s de-Stalinization in 1956 was not just a domestic political miscalculation, it was a catastrophic geopolitical error that weakened the USSR on the world stage. In a period defined by ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism, the Secret Speech at the 20th Party Congress gifted the United States and NATO what they had been lacking since 1917: an official acknowledgment from within the Soviet leadership that socialism had supposedly produced a “tyrant” and a “cult of personality.” This admission did not simply target Stalin; it delegitimized the entire Soviet project retroactively.



Before 1956, Western propaganda attacked the USSR but lacked internal confirmation. Khrushchev changed that overnight. By denouncing Stalin as a criminal and mass murderer, Khrushchev provided the West with free propaganda ammunition to fuel psychological warfare during the Cold War. Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, and Western newspapers immediately weaponized Khrushchev’s speech, broadcasting it across Eastern Europe to undermine the legitimacy of socialist governments (Kramer 1999). U.S. policymakers used it as evidence that communism was inherently tyrannical, accelerating cultural warfare and anti-communist sentiment worldwide (Andrew & Mitrokhin 1999).



The damage extended beyond propaganda. De-Stalinization fractured the global communist movement. It triggered ideological division among socialist states most notably the Sino-Soviet Split. Mao condemned Khrushchev for “revisionism” and betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, calling him “a Soviet Tito” (MacFarquhar 1997). Communist parties across Asia, Africa, and Latin America were suddenly divided between pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factions. What had been a unified anti-imperialist bloc now splintered, weakening socialist influence in the Third World during the height of decolonization.



Even worse, Khrushchev’s reforms emboldened nationalist uprisings in the Eastern Bloc. The 1956 Hungarian Uprising and later the 1968 Prague Spring emerged directly in response to perceived weakening of Soviet authority. Instead of stabilizing socialism, de-Stalinization unleashed political forces that threatened its foundations, forcing later leaders like Brezhnev to restore the very centralized discipline Khrushchev abandoned.



In effect, Khrushchev attempted to liberalize socialism before consolidating it, exposing contradictions that the system was not prepared to resolve. The West did not defeat the Soviet Union through military force, but through ideological erosion, a process that began the moment Khrushchev tore open the USSR’s historical narrative from within. By reducing the Stalin era to a morality tale rather than a historical necessity, Khrushchev allowed the West to frame Soviet history as illegitimate, paving the way for the ideological collapse of 1991



Conclusion



Stalin cannot be understood outside the historical conditions that produced him. His rule emerged not from personal ambition alone but from the structural imperatives of building socialism in a backward, encircled state under permanent threat. Industrialization, collectivization, and centralized power were not ideological distortions of Marxism but material responses to Russia’s economic underdevelopment and geopolitical isolation. Without Stalin’s forced-draft modernization, the USSR would not have survived Nazi invasion, nor would it have emerged as a superpower capable of shaping the 20th century.



Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin treated history as a question of morality rather than necessity. By isolating Stalin from the historical totality of Soviet development, de-Stalinization dismantled the stabilizing mechanisms of socialist construction before they were replaced with mature institutions. It fractured global socialism, empowered Western ideological warfare, and began the long erosion of Soviet legitimacy that culminated in 1991. Stalin was not the final stage of socialism, but a transitional necessity in its development. History is not written by moral preference but by material conditions and in those conditions, Stalin was not optional. He was inevitable.
